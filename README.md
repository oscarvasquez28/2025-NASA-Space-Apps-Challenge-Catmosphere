### 🛰️ Project Summary

This project is developed for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge** under the theme  
**“From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies.”**

Our application leverages **NASA’s TEMPO mission data** to forecast **air quality across North America** by integrating:
- Real-time **satellite-based pollution data** (from TEMPO)  
- **Ground-based air quality** measurements (e.g., PM2.5, O₃, NO₂)  
- **Weather data** (temperature, humidity, wind patterns)

The goal is to **predict and visualize air quality trends**, **notify users** of poor conditions, and **empower communities and policymakers** with actionable insights to improve public health and environmental awareness.
